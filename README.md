This is a python worm with some functions. It opens the cd drive, shows couple messageboxes plays a tune and copies itself to all removable drives and creates the autorun.inf files to all removable drives.
I used Visual studio code with the ai. Theres also the executable have not tried it yet. Should maybe work in windows 10 or not.
Functions2 is updated version. It uses batch command to add registry startup so it runs at system startup. It also copies the functions.exe to folder c:\marker and if the c:\marker\functions.exe exists
it quits the program. Funcions4 have mickey mouse and sends email let's party greetings. Functions6 also creates a shared folder "c:\myshare" and copies all txt and pdf files from drive c to that folder.
