This is a python worm with some functions. It opens the cd drive, shows couple messageboxes plays a tune and copies itself to all removable drives and creates the autorun.inf files to all removable drives.
I used Visual studio code with the ai. Theres also the executable have not tried it yet. Should maybe work in windows 10 or not.
